# Production Deployment Plan

This document outlines the plan for deploying the Drizzle ORM import standardization changes to production.

## Overview

The Drizzle ORM import standardization changes have been implemented and tested in the staging environment. This plan outlines the steps for deploying these changes to production.

## Deployment Window

- **Scheduled Date**: [TBD - Requires stakeholder approval]
- **Scheduled Time**: [TBD - Preferably during low-traffic hours]
- **Estimated Duration**: 30-60 minutes
- **Deployment Team**: [DevOps Lead, Developer Support]

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass in the staging environment
- [ ] Manual testing has been performed in staging
- [ ] No critical or blocking issues have been observed for 24+ hours
- [ ] Database migrations have been tested
- [ ] Rollback procedure has been reviewed
- [ ] Stakeholders have been informed of the deployment
- [ ] Backup of production database has been created

## Deployment Steps

1. **Preparation (15 minutes before deployment window)**
   - Notify team members of upcoming deployment
   - Verify all pre-deployment checklist items are complete
   - Prepare monitoring dashboards

2. **Deployment (during deployment window)**
   - Merge the `staging` branch to `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge staging
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Run the production deployment script:
     ```bash
     ./deploy-production.sh
     ```

3. **Verification (immediately after deployment)**
   - Verify the application is running correctly
   - Run automated tests in production environment
   - Verify Drizzle ORM imports are working correctly
   - Check application logs for any errors
   - Verify all services are operational

4. **Post-Deployment Monitoring (24 hours after deployment)**
   - Monitor application logs for errors
   - Monitor database performance
   - Monitor API response times
   - Check error tracking system (Sentry) for new errors

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are encountered during or after deployment, follow these steps to rollback:

1. **Decision to Rollback**
   - If blocking issues are encountered that prevent core functionality
   - If multiple critical errors are observed
   - If database integrity is compromised

2. **Rollback Steps**
   - Checkout the last stable version:
     ```bash
     git checkout [last-stable-tag]
     ```
   - Run the deployment script for that version:
     ```bash
     ./deploy-production.sh
     ```
   - Verify the rollback was successful
   - Notify stakeholders of the rollback

3. **Post-Rollback**
   - Document the issues that led to rollback
   - Create tickets for fixing the issues
   - Schedule a new deployment window

## Team Responsibilities

- **DevOps Lead**:
  - Execute deployment steps
  - Monitor system during deployment
  - Make go/no-go decision for rollback

- **Developer Support**:
  - Verify application functionality
  - Assist with troubleshooting
  - Document any issues

- **QA Team**:
  - Perform post-deployment testing
  - Verify critical workflows

## Communication Plan

- **Pre-Deployment**: Email to all stakeholders 24 hours before deployment
- **During Deployment**: Updates in deployment channel
- **Post-Deployment**: Email to all stakeholders with deployment status

## Success Criteria

The deployment will be considered successful if:

- All automated tests pass in production
- No critical or blocking issues are observed for 24 hours
- All key workflows function correctly
- Database operations perform as expected
- No regression in application performance
